    title: "Computational Optimal Transport: From Low to High Dimension and Back"
    abstract: |
        The *optimal transport* problem asks a simple geometric question:  What is the most efficient way to transform one probability distribution into another along a piece of geometry?  Beyond its mathematical interest, optimal transport underlies a variety of applications, from supply chains to mesh processing, statistics, and even generative AI.  Over the past two decades, research in geometry processing has played a central role in shaping algorithms for optimal transport, with foundational advances emerging from the SGP community.  At the same time, popular problems in applied optimal transport have shifted from low-dimensional settings in graphics and imaging to high-dimensional settings in machine learning.

        In this retrospective keynote, I will trace how my team's work in computational optimal transport was shaped by studying its applications to geometry processing---even as the landscape of research in this area shifted in dimensionality and application.  Ultimately, this journey illustrates the broader value of "Geometric Data Processing" as a discipline: identifying shared geometric and variational principles across domains that differ dramatically in dimension, scale, and data fidelity.
