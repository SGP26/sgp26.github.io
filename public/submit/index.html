<h4 id="dataset-papers">Dataset Papers.</h4>
<p>SGP is encouraging submission of <em>dataset papers</em> to the main technical papers program. Geometric datasets play a critical role in evaluating the behavior of geometric algorithms, and in recent years have provided interesting and challenging examples that have driven the field forward. We are therefore looking for papers that can build on this success by providing, documenting, and discussing datasets that provide larger, more challenging datasets than those seen before—or datasets that stimulate new challenges in geometry processing (e.g., new kinds of data that in turn demand new kinds of algorithms). Importantly, however, a good dataset paper is more than just a dump of raw data. We are looking for thoughtfully-written companion papers, to be evaluated according to the following criteria:</p>
<p>NOVELTY. In what way(s) is the dataset different from those currently available? For instance, does it provide new kinds of “rich” data? Is it organized or annotated in a different way? It is representative of a different application domain—perhaps one that is not well-studied in geometry processing? Is it significantly larger/higher-resolution than previous datasets? Does it provide new challenges for robustness? Etc.</p>
<p>IMPACT. What is the potential impact on research in geometry processing? Will this dataset inspire the development of new kinds of algorithms? Will it significantly push forward the state of the art in terms of scalability, robustness, etc.? Does it help resolve clearly-defined holes or shortcomings of previous datasets?</p>
<p>PRESENTATION. Is the paper itself well-written and well-organized? Is the purpose of the new dataset clearly explained and motivated? Does the paper make a compelling case that the dataset presents new opportunities or challenges (e.g., experiments indicating that current algorithms do not perform well on this data). Is the data itself clearly described and documented? Are sufficient details provided about, e.g., the acquisition process, or other metadata that may be useful/necessary for interpreting the data?</p>
<p>ACCESSIBILITY. Is the dataset easy to access/examine? For instance, if the dataset is very large, is there a mechanism for accessing only individual files or examples? Are files stored in standard/open formats, and/or do the authors provide guidance on how to convert data stored in non-standard formats? Do the authors provide tools that help to inspect/visualize novel or unusual “rich” data? Where will the data set be hosted, and is there a plan for ensuring the dataset will remain available in the future? Is the license clearly defined, and/or are there any significant intellectual property issues associated with sharing the dataset?</p>
<p>PRIVACY AND ETHICS. Does the paper carefully address potential issues of anonymity or personally identifying information? Does it discuss any ethical issues around acquisition of the data, or potential use/misuse of data outside the intended context?</p>
<p>These criteria will also be provided to reviewers and committee members during the review period. Authors interested in examples of successful dataset papers may wish to consult the following list:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The dataset papers will be published similarly to the technical papers, in the same Computer Graphics Forum special issue.</p>
<h3 id="typesetting">Typesetting</h3>
<p>Please format your article using the template for SGP available on the SRMv2 website: <a href="https://srmv2.eg.org/">https://srmv2.eg.org</a>. SGP does not impose a strict maximum length for submitted papers. However, Computer Graphics Forum and SGP recommend that research papers be up to 10 pages (including all images, but excluding references). Papers should only be as long as their content would justify. Reviewers might rate a submission lower if it is perceived as being unnecessarily long. Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content.</p>
<h3 id="anonymization">Anonymization</h3>
<p>Review is based on a <a href="https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter">dual-anonymous</a> reviewing process: submission authors do not know the identity of their reviewers and reviewers do not know the identity of submission authors (or each other). All submitted papers must be anonymized. Please be sure to remove all personal data (such as authors, affiliations, etc.) from your submission. References to your own work should be made in the third person. Reviewers are asked to keep confidentiality on all materials sent to them for evaluation.</p>
<h3 id="submitting-your-article">Submitting your article</h3>
<p>Articles must be submitted, in electronic pdf format, using the <a href="https://srmv2.eg.org">Submission and Review Management (SRMv2) system</a>.</p>
<h3 id="recommended-abstract-submission">(Recommended) Abstract submission</h3>
<p>In order for a paper to be considered for publication, a corresponding abstract must be submitted. Although the abstract submission deadline (see timeline above) is not mandatory and will not prevent a full paper submission, it is strongly encouraged to abide by it, to help assign relevant reviewers (paper bidding done on the abstract provided by the abstract deadline).</p>
<h3 id="reviewing-process">Reviewing process</h3>
<p>Submitted papers undergo a two-stage review process, involving dual-anonymous assessment by carefully selected reviewers from the <a href="/organization/#technical-papers-committee">technical papers committee</a>. Articles are conditionally accepted after the first round. Final acceptance is determined in the second round, based on the revised version of the article.</p>
<h3 id="anonymity-and-preprints">Anonymity and Preprints</h3>
<p>We are adopting the same policy as SIGGRAPH (which is similar to CVPR) on preprints, including those shared via arXiv. Following this policy almost verbatim, we recognize that prepublications and talks have become part of the scientific discourse, and SGP allows these means of communication. Specifically, before the final acceptance decision is made:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Authors must not discuss the research described in submitted SGP papers with the media. Media includes editors/journalists/writers/interviewers of newspapers, radio, television, magazines, as well as public relations and media arms of companies, universities, and other research institutions.</li>
<li>After submitting to SGP, authors may archive the submission without mentioning SGP as an institutional tech report or on arXiv or a similar service.</li>
<li>Authors must not make any posts to social media or elsewhere that can be linked to a specific SGP submission (e.g., mentioning the title of the submission or details and content and saying that it is a SGP submission).</li>
<li>Authors may talk about their work in a presentation without saying it is submitted to SGP.</li>
<li>Authors may mention their submission(s) as under review at SGP as part of the written materials submitted for job and funding applications. Authors may talk about the research involved in their submission in talks given for these purposes as well, without mentioning SGP.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="proceedings">Proceedings</h3>
<p>The SGP proceedings will appear as a regular electronic issue of Computer Graphics Forum, the International Journal of the EUROGRAPHICS Association. The journal status of the proceedings requires a two-stage review process with conditional acceptance after the first round and final acceptance based on the revised submissions.</p>
<h3 id="awards-and-recognitions">Awards and Recognitions</h3>
<p>Following its traditions, SGP 2026 will attribute three best paper awards, a software award recognising the authors of an open-source software that has greatly influenced the field, and a data set award designed to acknowledge the suppliers of high quality datasets used in geometry processing. In addition, SGP may provide papers with the reproducibility stamp to recognise the effort of researchers who, in addition to publishing their paper at SGP 2026, provide a complete open-source implementation of their algorithm.</p>
<p>Please send nominations to <a href="mailto:awardnominations@geometryprocessing.org">awardnominations@geometryprocessing.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="call-for-posters">Call for Posters</h2>
<p>We invite authors to submit proposals for poster presentations that highlight innovative research, preliminary findings, novel ideas, ongoing projects in the field of geometry processing, as well as refined methods or applications of already published research. We welcome submissions from a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:</p>
